# Django_API
Creating a Django API endpoint that allows users to create and update their profiles. The profile should include fields such as name, email, bio, and profile picture. Users should be able to send POST requests to create a new profile or PATCH requests to update their existing profile.

Requirements:
1. Create a Django API endpoint that listens to POST and PATCH requests for creating and updating user profiles.
2. The endpoint should validate the incoming data, ensuring that required fields are provided and that the email is in a valid format.
3. If the data is valid, create a new profile or update the existing profile in the database.
4. Return appropriate HTTP responses and messages to indicate the success or failure of the operation.
5. Implement proper URL routing for the API endpoint.
6. Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring that only authenticated users can create or update profiles.
7. Write unit tests to verify the functionality of the API endpoint.
